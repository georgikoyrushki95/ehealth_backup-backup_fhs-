                <p class="lead">The Federated Health Search Application provides a secure and quick way for you to search for
                different conditions, medicines, symptoms and treatments.
                Users can search in the general web - Bing, and two specialised medical websites - Medline Plus and healthfinder.gov.<br/><br/>
                Registered users can create categories and save resources they find into them. Moreover, they can maintain their public profile
                and choose whether to share their categories with other users of the website.
                    The application should help the users understand if the information is easy to read,
                    is loaded with sentiment and subjectivity.
                Created by students at the University of Glasgow. For educational purposes only.
